# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:


"Hello World".include?("Hello")
#The .include? method checks to see if the string "Hello World" has the string "Hello" in it 
#and returns true or false.

"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")
#The .end_with? method checks to see if the string "Hello World" has the string "Hello"
#at the end of it and returns a true or false.
 "Hello World".end_with?("rld")
#This .end_with? method checks to see if the string "Hello World" has the string "rld"
#at the end of it and returns a true or false.
12.even?
#The .even method determines if 12 is even or odd.

p 18.next
#The .next method determines the next number after 18 and 
#returns its value.
