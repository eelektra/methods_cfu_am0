# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

I feel pretty confident because of the methods documentation in ruby-docs.  I have been able to experiment and figure out several how to use them during today's lesson and assignments.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

Less confident than using the ruby provided ones.  There is a high probability some small charactor or space will stall me.
Hopefully with practice and reading error messages I will get better at writing definitions.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

Once you define a method, how do you call it in other programs?
